# Masking Facial Identity: A Machine Learning Approach for Privacy Protection

## Introduction
In an era dominated by advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in deep learning and facial recognition technologies, the need to safeguard individual privacy has become increasingly critical. The rapid progress in deep learning has raised concerns about the privacy of facial images, emphasizing the necessity for innovative privacy protection methods. This project introduces a novel approach that goes beyond traditional methods, aiming to selectively hide and remove all facial features through an iterative machine learning process.

## Related Work
Previous attempts at facial feature concealment often compromised image quality. Recent advancements, including three notable algorithms utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs), have successfully removed facial features while preserving image quality. In contrast, our approach employs a pipeline of adversarial networks to systematically remove facial attributes, minimizing the trade-off between privacy and image fidelity.

## Problem Statement
This project addresses the challenge of developing an algorithm that takes an input face image and produces a protected image with specific properties. The algorithm aims to preserve image similarity, maintain compatibility with non-attribute machine learning tests, and obfuscate facial attributes effectively. Our solution is designed to outperform existing methods in meeting these criteria, emphasizing the importance of balancing privacy protection and machine learning system functionality.
